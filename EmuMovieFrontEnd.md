## Description ##

This program was written about 2006 with the intent of being able to associate movie files (such as .fcm) with an Emulator.  It searches your ROM folder for a match to the movie file, if found it will open the emulator + rom and then play the movie.  Watching movies is just one click away!


### TODO ###
Add VS 2008 & 2010 proj files (might as well add them rather than replace)
This is written in C# why not a GUI instead of console interface?
Add new emulators and movie formats (desmume, fceux, pcsx, etc)
Ability to look in 7z files for compatibility with good sets
